# LAMIRA - Linking Appearance and MeanIng by Recognition in artificial Agents
A system structured as a chatbot is proposed, allowing the user to make requests and, following processing by the system, a response message will be played vocally. The user can place an object in front of an RGB-D sensor, allowing the system to extract the perceptual characteristics of the object related to color, shape and texture.
Perceptions are used to search within a knowledge base of the system for an object or type of perception recognized as similar to the one being framed. Perceptions can also be stored in order to expand the knowledge base of individual perceptions and objects.
